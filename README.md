# Mental Health Chatbot using Python
My first task as Machine learning intern at sync's interns 
This project is a chatbot developed in Python that aims to provide support and resources for individuals struggling with mental health issues.
The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to users' messages, providing a friendly and non-judgmental environment for them to express their thoughts and feelings.
